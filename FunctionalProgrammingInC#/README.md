This book comes highly rated, the first edition had a glowing 4.5 stars on Manning's website and an impressive 4.65 on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31550964-functional-programming-in-c?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=VlV30uC1Zb&rank=1), with no scores below three stars.
All of the three-star reviews are devoid of written reviews, so it's hard to say what lead to the lower ratings, and it could just be picky readers.

## About the Author

Information about Buonanno is somewhat sparse online, with most of the information being duplicated among sites. It seems to be the case that he is a relatively standard developer; no big-name or Microsoft MVP status.
However, that doesn't indicate that he is a poor programmer, and certainly is no indication of his skills as an author. With this little information, all we can really do is read and determine for ourselves what we think.

From his Udemy profile:

> Enrico Buonanno obtained an MS in Computer Science at Columbia University in 2001 and has been working as a software developer and architect since.
