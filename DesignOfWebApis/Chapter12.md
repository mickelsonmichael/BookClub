# Documenting an API

## 12.1 Creating reference documentation

## 12.2 Creating a user guide

## 12.3 Providing adequate information to implementers

## 12.4 Documenting evolutions and retirement

## Summary

> - API designers must participate in the creation of different types of API documentation.
> - A detailed reference documentation is a good thing, but it is not enough. We must also create a user's guide.
> - User guides must provide all needed information to use the API as a whole, including how to obtain credentials and tokens.
> - Leveraging an API description language such as the OpenAPI Specification can be of great help when creating documentation.
> - It is important to keep track of modifications in order to inform users of changes.
> - Creating documentation helps to test the API design.
