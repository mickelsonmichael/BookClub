# Mike's Project Euler Solutions

__Do not use this to answer the questions!__ That defeats the purpose of the problems. You should be solving them yourself and hopefully learning something along the way!

You should only check these out when you've completed the problem yourself. You can compare my solutions to your own and see if there's a better way to do things! And if I did something inefficient, bring it up and we can discuss it! We should both learn from it
